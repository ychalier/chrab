## contribution

Please make your changes on your personal and properly named branch, then PR to the branch `development`. Do not update `production` unless you perfectly know what you are doing. We will keep branch `master` for general information about the project, and possibly a GitHub Pages webpage to present the project when we'll reach our goal.

See this (private) [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/atZzWEwe/sraberry) to remain updated on developmment progress.
